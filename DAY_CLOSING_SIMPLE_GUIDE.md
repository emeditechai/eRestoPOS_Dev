## 🎓 EXAMPLE (Real Numbers)

### Morning (9 AM)
```
Manager sets opening float for "Ramesh" = ₹2,000
```

### Throughout the day
```
Ramesh processes orders:
- 30 customers pay CASH = ₹15,000
- 20 customers pay CARD = ₹12,000 (not counted in cash)

Computer tracks: System ₹ = ₹15,000 (only CASH)
```

### Evening (10 PM) - Ramesh counts cash
```
Physical cash in drawer:
- ₹2000 notes: 7 = ₹14,000
- ₹500 notes: 4 = ₹2,000
- ₹100 notes: 8 = ₹800
- Coins: ₹250
Total counted = ₹17,050

Expected = Opening ₹2,000 + System ₹15,000 = ₹17,000
Counted = ₹17,050
Variance = +₹50 (Cash Over - You have ₹50 extra)

Since ₹50 < ₹100 threshold: Status = OK ✅ (Auto-approved!)
```

### Night (10:30 PM) - Manager locks
```
All cashiers declared: ✅
All variances approved: ✅
Click "Lock Day"
Print EOD Report
Go home! 🏠
```
